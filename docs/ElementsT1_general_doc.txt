"CHANGES" library is a software designed to operate with terms, concepts and ideas of chinese philosophy and 
first of all book of changes -"I Ching'.
The library allows you to introduce and operate with trigrams and hexagrames, Wu Xing, stems and branches, use traditional chinese
solar-lunar calendar, calculations of acupuncture points and channels for treatment...etc.

The "CHANGES" library operates in Linux, Mac Os X and Windows systems, for installation instruction read ElementsT1_installation_doc.txt.

The "CHANGES" library  is distributed under MIT license, for more information read License.txt.

This library is intended to be used by :

1) Acupuncturists - traditional chinese methods are implemented in the library, including calculation of 
acupuncture points for pain treatment and pulse counting and analysis. These functions should be used by 
sertified acupuncturists only.

2) Ichinists - scientists and philosophers who use I Ching in thier work. For them a lot of operations and 
analysis procedures are implemented.

3) Practitioners of I Ching divination - for them several traditional chinese divination methods are
implemented - Hsien Tien, Hu Tien, Dice and Coins divination.

For those who wants to go deeper into I CHing I recomend to start with book 
"The Tao of I Ching Way to Divination" Jou, Tsung Hwa, 1984.
For medical doctors, who wants to use I Ching - the book
"The medical I Ching, oracle of the healer within", Miki Shima, 1992.
I recommend to purchase these books.

The basic tems in "CHANGES" library are elements. They can be hexagrams, trigrams or other.
These elements (hexagrams/trigrams/other) are organized into sets.
They are subject to following Names convention:
Each set name should be unique.
Set names should be only english.
Each element in the set has unique name in english only. This key name identifies the element and can not be changed.
In Set Editor (see below) this name defines "current element" it is entered/copied into "Element name:" line - with wich other operetions are performed.
The properties can be defined for each element in the set.
Property is a pair "Property name":"Property value".
Property names should be only english too.
The values of properties might be english, chinese or cyrilic, as well as multilanguage 'name/note' properties.
Shot names of channels and acupuncture points in english ( english notation ):
'GB','BL','LI','ST','TB','SI','KID','LIV','LU','Sp','Ht','HG',
extraordinary - 'CV','GV','TV','BV','InnLV','YangLV','InnHV','YangHV',
for no channel points -'NoCh'.
point are numbered like 'BL-40'.
The name of the channel can be only from the list above, no arbitrary names.
The name of the point can be only english in form 'BL-1','BL-2',etc.
Shot names of channels and acupuncture points in french ( french notation ):
'VB','V','GI','E','TR','IG','R', 'F','P','Rp','C','MC',extraordinary - 'VC','VG',
point are numbered like 'V-40' only.
Strict names for channels and points are nessesary because each channel has 2 lists with points in
english and french notation - the points are added and deleted from these lists each time new point is
added or deleted from the system.
The library supports both english and french notation, however function names are different - 
a function which uses french notation hahe 'fr' letter added to the name. 
The results of calculation of acupuncture point usually are given in form TR 5  (TB 5) -
french notation first, followed by english notaion in brackets.

The library can be used and is fully functional in console mode ( Ipython in Linux and Mac Os X and Pythonwin in windows )
Usage advises in console mode  are given in  ElementsT1_getting_started_guide.txt.

As well the library have graphical modules. ( for free download is avalable only console version at the moment )

points for pain treatment.

2) "Pulse calculation" - this module is intended for acupuncturists and is used for pulse calculation and analysis.

3) "Hexagram table" - this is reference module for hexagrams/trigrams.
