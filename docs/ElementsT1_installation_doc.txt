"CHANGES" library is developed for use in Linux, Mac Os X and Windows. Installation and configuration tipps are given here for each system.
You need to install support for chinese language in your system,  if you have not done yet.

1. Download and install python 2.7, if it's not already part of you system.
to check open terminal and type "python" then press enter. 
If you are going to use the library from terminal install Ipython in linux and mac os, In windows install Pythonwin.
2. Install gcc, gcc-c++ compilers and dependencies - in mac os x download and install xcode - version sutable for your system version! 
in windows better use precompiled packages.
3. Install PyQt4 and dependencies.
4. Install using pip python packages:
   dill
   networkx
   numpy
   matplotlib
   termcolor
   ephem 
   lunardate
   in windows you can use precompiled packages from
   http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
5. Copy Library files into directory ( Linux Macos X):
  
  /home/username/Changesv001
  
  in windows to
  
  C:\Changesv001\
  
  add this directory to $PYTHONPATH system variable.
  
  in file ElementsT1.py edit 
  libdir ='/Changesv001'
  in windows
  WorkingDirectory = r"C:\Changesv001"
  SetsDirectory = r"C:\Changesv001"
  ChImagesDirectory = r"C:\Changesv001\images\channels"
  PImagesDirectory = r"C:\Changesv001\images\points"
  correct names/pathes for default sets if nessesary.
  according to your installation.
  in file ChangesT1_medical.py edit for windows:
  PatientsDataDirectory = r"C:\Changesv001\p"
  PTimagesDirectory = r"C:\Changesv001\p\timg"
   
  in file ChangesT1_StemsBranches.py edit coordinates:
  LAT = '50:27'   # '36:02'
  LON = '30:31'   # '103:48'   
  DUTC = 2        # 8              use for places with no DST, for DST places use DUTC = difUTC()
  PLACE = 'Kiev'  # 'LANZHOU'
  
  make sure that your system time setting - date and time and timezone are set correctly!
  Difference between your system clock and local time should be no more then 1 minut! 
  this is basic requiement for correct functioning of the Library.
  
6. If you are going to use only graphical modules in Linux and Macos X  
open terminal cd to /home/username/Changesv001
and type
python ChLib.py &

this will open the module selector.
In windows create a shortcut for ChLib.py file and place it on the desctop.
Double click on it will start the module selector.

7. If you are going to use the Library from the terminal open it 
cd to /home/username/Changesv001
and start ipython.
then you can use command 
%run load_def_sets.py
to load default sets.

in windows start pythonwin and press "run script" button to run
 load_def_sets.py
