( console mode )

there are 2 classes of copy operations in Changes library - they work differetly with 
floating yaos - 1st class ( copy_El and basic_copy and function that uses them like
find_in_set ) - they do not copy floating yao information - this is useful if you need to 
copy basic information from the hexagram set - using find_in_set function.
2nd class ( copy_El_float and copy_by_name ) - they copy element including
floating yao information. this is useful if you have obtained a hexagram with floating 
yaos and you want to make a full copy of it for futher processing.
please note if the operation takes the element El as second parametr it shoul not be confused
with the name of the element and adressed like Group.elements["Name"] or
by iterator inside the group.

description of copy functions:

1st class

1. copy_El( Name, El)

    element El is copied and added to current group under the Name
        ATTN: floating yaos are not copied!
        
2. basic_copy( Name, El)

      element El is copied ( not floating yaos !)  
      and basic properties too
      basic properties are the field of the element:
      El.hex , El.Ucode, El.ChName, El.ChNote, El.RName, El.EngName, El.Note, El.RNote, El.HNumber
 
3. copy_properties(Name,El)

        element El properties are copied to Name element
        
 not a copy operation! but useful for addind aditional information
 
    find_in_set( Name, FoundName, SetName):
        finds elenemt with the same yaos like Name in Setname
        found element is added to the group under name FoundName
        if FoundName = Name basic info from set is added,
        ATTN: floating yao info is conserved like in original hexagram,
        not copied from the set
        
2nd class

4. copy_El_float( Name, El):
        Element is copied including floating Yaos and basic properties
        basic properties are the field of the element:
        El.hex , El.Ucode, El.ChName, El.ChNote, El.RName, El.EngName, El.Note, El.RNote, El.HNumber

5. copy_full_El(Name,El):

        copies full El - yaos,float yaos, basic info and properties

6.  copy_by_name(ElName,Name):
	this operation works only inside working group and takeas as arguments only
	element names, not the El itself like in previous operations.
        element Elname is copied inside the group and assigned name Name
